## ⚡ **INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCEDURES**

### **Phase 1: Identification (0-15 minutes)**

#### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Verify the Incident**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   curl -f https://api.innospot.com/health || echo "API DOWN"
   
   # Check database connectivity
   psql -c "SELECT NOW();" || echo "DB UNAVAILABLE"
   
   # Check recent security events
   psql -c "SELECT event_type, severity, COUNT(*) FROM security_events 
            WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' 
            GROUP BY event_type, severity ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;"
   ```

2. **Document Initial Findings**
   - Time of detection
   - Detection method
   - Initial symptoms
   - Affected systems/users
   - Potential impact assessment

3. **Activate Incident Response Team**
   ```bash
   # Send alert to incident response team
   curl -X POST https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents \
     -H "Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "incident": {
         "type": "incident",
         "title": "Security Incident - InnoSpot Platform",
         "service": {"id": "SERVICE_ID", "type": "service_reference"},
         "urgency": "high",
         "body": {"type": "incident_body", "details": "Security incident detected"}
       }
     }'
   ```

#### **Classification Decision Tree**
```
Incident Detected
├── Data Breach Suspected?
│   ├── Yes → P0/P1 (depending on scope)
│   └── No → Continue assessment
├── System Compromise?
│   ├── Yes → P0/P1 (depending on privileges)
│   └── No → Continue assessment
├── Service Disruption?
│   ├── Yes → P1/P2 (depending on impact)
│   └── No → P2/P3
└── Regulatory Implications?
    ├── Yes → Escalate classification
    └── No → Maintain classification
```

### **Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)**

#### **Short-term Containment**
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   ```sql
   -- Disable compromised user accounts
   UPDATE users SET deleted_at = NOW() 
   WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM security_events 
                WHERE event_type = 'unauthorized_access' 
                AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour');
   
   -- Revoke active sessions for compromised accounts
   DELETE FROM user_sessions 
   WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL);
   ```

2. **Implement Emergency Access Controls**
   ```sql
   -- Enable emergency lockdown mode
   INSERT INTO security_events (event_type, severity, message, details)
   VALUES ('emergency_lockdown', 'critical', 'Emergency access controls activated',
     jsonb_build_object('activated_by', auth.uid(), 'reason', 'security_incident'));
   
   -- Temporarily restrict high-risk operations
   UPDATE rate_limits 
   SET max_requests = 1, blocked_until = NOW() + INTERVAL '1 hour'
   WHERE endpoint IN ('vector_search', 'ai_agent_execution', 'data_export');
   ```

3. **Preserve Evidence**
   ```bash
   # Create forensic snapshots
   pg_dump --no-owner --no-privileges innospot_db > forensic_dump_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   
   # Backup security logs
   psql -c "\COPY security_events TO 'security_events_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).csv' CSV HEADER;"
   
   # Preserve system logs
   journalctl --since="1 hour ago" > system_logs_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
   ```

#### **Long-term Containment**
1. **Network Segmentation**
   - Isolate affected network segments
   - Implement additional firewall rules
   - Monitor inter-segment traffic

2. **Access Review and Restrictions**
   ```sql
   -- Audit current active sessions
   SELECT u.email, s.ip_address, s.user_agent, s.last_activity
   FROM user_sessions s
   JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.id
   WHERE s.expires_at > NOW()
   ORDER BY s.last_activity DESC;
   
   -- Implement enhanced authentication requirements
   UPDATE user_sessions 
   SET requires_mfa = true, security_level = 'enhanced'
   WHERE expires_at > NOW();
   ```

### **Phase 3: Eradication (1-4 hours)**

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Technical Investigation**
   ```sql
   -- Analyze attack vectors
   WITH incident_timeline AS (
     SELECT event_type, user_id, ip_address, timestamp, details
     FROM security_events
     WHERE timestamp BETWEEN 'INCIDENT_START' AND 'INCIDENT_END'
     ORDER BY timestamp
   )
   SELECT * FROM incident_timeline;
   
   -- Identify compromised data
   SELECT table_name, operation, COUNT(*) as operations
   FROM audit_trail
   WHERE timestamp BETWEEN 'INCIDENT_START' AND 'INCIDENT_END'
   AND user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM compromised_accounts)
   GROUP BY table_name, operation;
   ```

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Identify exploited vulnerabilities
   - Assess patch levels and configurations
   - Review access controls and permissions

#### **Threat Elimination**
1. **Remove Malicious Code/Access**
   ```sql
   -- Remove unauthorized database objects
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS suspicious_table_name;
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS unauthorized_function();
   
   -- Reset compromised authentication credentials
   UPDATE mcp_integrations 
   SET authentication_encrypted = NULL, 
       encryption_key_id = 'incident_reset_' || gen_random_uuid()
   WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM potentially_compromised_integrations);
   ```

2. **Patch Vulnerabilities**
   ```bash
   # Apply critical security patches
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   
   # Update database security configurations
   psql -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'all';"
   psql -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET log_connections = on;"
   psql -c "SELECT pg_reload_conf();"
   ```

3. **Strengthen Security Controls**
   ```sql
   -- Implement additional security policies
   CREATE POLICY "incident_response_enhanced_audit" ON users
     FOR ALL USING (true)
     WITH CHECK (log_security_event('user_modification', 'medium', 
       'User modification during incident response', 
       jsonb_build_object('user_id', id, 'operation', TG_OP)));
   ```

### **Phase 4: Recovery (4-24 hours)**

#### **System Restoration**
1. **Gradual Service Restoration**
   ```sql
   -- Restore normal rate limits gradually
   UPDATE rate_limits 
   SET max_requests = max_requests * 2, blocked_until = NULL
   WHERE blocked_until > NOW()
   AND max_requests < 50; -- Don't exceed normal limits yet
   
   -- Re-enable user accounts after verification
   UPDATE users 
   SET deleted_at = NULL 
   WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM verified_clean_accounts);
   ```

2. **Data Integrity Verification**
   ```sql
   -- Verify audit trail integrity
   WITH audit_chain AS (
     SELECT id, checksum, previous_checksum,
            encode(sha256((id::TEXT || table_name || record_id::TEXT || 
                          operation || COALESCE(old_values::TEXT, '') || 
                          COALESCE(new_values::TEXT, '') || timestamp::TEXT ||
                          COALESCE(LAG(checksum) OVER (ORDER BY sequence_number), ''))::BYTEA), 'hex') as expected_checksum
     FROM audit_trail
     WHERE timestamp > 'INCIDENT_START'
     ORDER BY sequence_number
   )
   SELECT COUNT(*) as integrity_violations
   FROM audit_chain
   WHERE checksum != expected_checksum;
   ```

3. **Security Monitoring Enhancement**
   ```sql
   -- Implement enhanced monitoring for affected areas
   INSERT INTO security_events (event_type, severity, message, details)
   VALUES ('enhanced_monitoring_enabled', 'medium', 'Enhanced security monitoring activated',
     jsonb_build_object('monitoring_duration', '72 hours', 
                       'affected_systems', ARRAY['user_auth', 'data_access', 'api_calls']));
   ```
