SIMPLE CMS DEPLOYMENT STEPS
============================

The error happened because you copied markdown formatting. Here are the clean steps:

STEP 1: Open Supabase
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lkpykvqkobvldrpdktks
- Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Click "New query"

STEP 2: Run Migration 1
- Open the file: CLEAN_SQL_DEPLOYMENT.sql
- Copy ALL the SQL content (ignore the comments with dashes)
- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
- Click "Run"
- You should see "Success. No rows returned"

STEP 3: Run Migration 2  
- Click "New query" again
- Open the file: MIGRATION_2_SECURITY.sql
- Copy ALL the SQL content
- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
- Click "Run"
- You should see "Success. No rows returned"

STEP 4: Run Migration 3
- Click "New query" again  
- Open the file: MIGRATION_3_SAMPLE_DATA.sql
- Copy ALL the SQL content
- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
- Click "Run"
- You should see "Success. No rows returned"

STEP 5: Verify It Worked
- In your terminal, run: node check-cms-status.js
- You should see "CMS Schema Deployed Successfully!"
- You should see 8 categories listed

STEP 6: Test Your App
- Run: npm run dev
- Go to the Showcase page
- You should see the sample items loaded from the database

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Copy ONLY the SQL commands, not the comment lines that start with --
- Each migration should complete without errors
- If you get syntax errors, make sure you're not copying markdown formatting
- The files are clean SQL with no formatting issues

FILES TO USE:
1. CLEAN_SQL_DEPLOYMENT.sql (Creates tables)
2. MIGRATION_2_SECURITY.sql (Sets up security)  
3. MIGRATION_3_SAMPLE_DATA.sql (Adds sample data)

After deployment, you can make yourself admin by running this in Supabase:
UPDATE public.users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
