## **Troubleshooting**

### **If Demo User Login Fails:**
1. **Check Migration**: Ensure `010_create_demo_user.sql` was executed successfully
2. **Verify Database**: Check that users exist in `auth.users` table
3. **Check Email Confirmed**: Ensure `email_confirmed_at` is not NULL

### **If Dashboard Features Don't Work:**
1. **Check Migration**: Ensure `008_ultra_safe_dashboard.sql` was executed
2. **Verify Tables**: Confirm `dashboards` table exists
3. **Check RLS**: Verify Row Level Security policies are active

### **If Build Errors Occur:**
1. **TypeScript**: Ensure all TS errors are fixed (should be resolved)
2. **Environment**: Check that Supabase env variables are set
3. **Dependencies**: Verify all npm packages are installed

## **Database Schema Summary**

The demo users are created in these tables:
- `auth.users` - Core user authentication data
- `auth.identities` - Authentication provider data  
- `public.dashboards` - Sample dashboard data (if table exists)

## **Security Notes**

🔒 **Production Security:**
- Demo passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Users have standard authenticated role permissions
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce data isolation
- No admin privileges granted to demo users

⚠️ **Important:**
- These are demo accounts for testing only
- In production, implement proper user registration flow
- Consider removing or restricting demo users for final deployment

## **Need Help?**

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Supabase logs for authentication errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure all database migrations have been run in order
4. Test locally first before deploying to production
